# Loppan
Loppan is the Swedish word for the fun yet simple paper origami game: pick a color, fortune teller, or chatterbox (It's a game with many names).
It's a game where you create a "Loppa"/fortune teller with 8 different tasks or questions to execute. Each assignment or question has its color. This Loppan game is a math learning game with basic math equations for the player to solve.

## User Stories
The User Stories for this project are the following:
* A welcome menu that gives the user different options on how to proceed with the program. 
* A section about the game with relevant information. Information such as game rules, the game's different names, and from where the game originates.
* The game and all its functions and features.
* Instructions on how the user can create their own paper Loppa.

### Colour Scheme (explain your colors, etc.... perhaps use coolors.co?)
### Workflow (include screenshots of your workflow)

## Features
### Existing Features
* Menu
  The user will first encounter a menu when starting the program. The menu gives the user four options to choose between: 
  * About the Game
  * Play the Game 
  * Create your Own 
  * Exit
  Each of these options will run a function that either prints text with information or instruction, starts the game, and, lastly, exit the program. 

* Section about the Game
    The about section gives the user informational text about the game Loppan.  All the common names it goes under in English. The user can also read about the game rules, from where the game originated, and get the acknowledgment in the western world. 
    The section also provides references to websites with more information.

* Game
    The game starts with the user selecting a number between 1 to 10. 
    For the player to submit a number is done with an input request. If the user tries to submit a number lower than 1 or higher than 10, a letter, a special sign, or a blank space, they will receive an Error message telling them to insert the correct value. Once the right value is submitted, the terminal will print the chosen number and take the player to the next step of the game.

    When the Loppa has validated the chosen number, a list will be printed in the terminal, containing 4 colors, text instruction, and an input field. 
    The instruction will tell the player to choose 1 of the 4 colors from the given list into the input field. As with the number input, if the player tries to submit a value that is not one of the colors from the list or a number or other special sign, they will get an Error message, telling them to submit the correct value to proceed with the game.

    When the user has submitted a valid value, they will get a task to execute from the selected color. In this case, a math equation of either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. 

    The math equation will always be a new one if the player, for example, picks multiplication two times in a row.

* Instructions on how the user can create their own paper Loppa
    The instruction section is a walk-through guide that the user can follow to create their own Loppa. It provides the user with the necessary tools and supplements that are needed to make one.

### Features Left to Implement
* A feature to implement would be to connect more "Loppor"/Fortune tellers; for example, the player could choose to play one with math or words or learn words from different languages.
