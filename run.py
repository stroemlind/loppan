    About the Game Loppan
    Loppan is the Swedish name for the childrens game: fortune teller,
    cootie catcher, chatterbox, salt cellar, whirlybird, or paku-paku.
    Loppan is a form of origami and made out of paper. The loppa are labeled
    with colors and/or numbers.
    These serve as an option for the player to choose. Inside each label,
    there is a message or a task for the player to execute.
    The person operating the loppa manipulates the device based on the choices
    made by the player, often folding the loppa a certain amount of time
    and then revealing one of the hidden messages chosen by the player.
